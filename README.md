# Phase I

## üìÑ Project Title: HOOF-CARE ‚Äì A Horse Racing & Health Monitoring Database System

This repository contains the PowerPoint presentation for **Phase I** of the HOOF-CARE project, which models a Management Information System (MIS) focused on improving the health monitoring and race performance of horses.

# Phase II

## üìù Business Process Modeling: HOOF-CARE ‚Äì Horse Health & Performance Tracking

This phase focuses on **visualizing the business process** of the HOOF-CARE Management Information System (MIS) using a **BPMN swimlane diagram**. It maps how health, training, and race participation data flows between key stakeholders and systems to support better decision-making in horse racing.

---

## üìå Scope Definition

**Business Process:** Racehorse Health and Performance Monitoring

**Relevance to MIS:**  
The process ensures real-time collection and use of critical data (health status, training logs, race results), enabling trainers, veterinarians, and race organizers to make informed, data-driven decisions.

**Objectives:**
- Accurately log and track training sessions and health checks.
- Automatically analyze horse readiness for racing events.
- Approve or restrict race participation based on real-time insights.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Safer race conditions through medical oversight.
- Improved race preparation strategies.
- Transparent communication between all stakeholders.

## üßç‚Äç Entities and Roles

| Entity            | Role & Responsibilities                                                   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trainer**        | Logs training data and monitors performance trends.                      |
| **Veterinarian**   | Performs health checks and updates medical records.                      |
| **Horse Owner**    | Monitors horse status and gets notified of approvals/restrictions.       |
| **Race Organizer** | Decides race eligibility based on health and training reports.           |
| **Betting Agency** | (Limited access) Uses race history for odds and analysis.                |
| **HOOF-CARE System** | Central system that stores and processes all data interactions.        |

## üîÑ Process Flow Summary

1. **Trainer** initiates a training session and logs performance.
2. **Veterinarian** performs a health check and logs results.
3. The **HOOF-CARE System** analyzes inputs.
4. If the horse is **fit**, the **Race Organizer** is notified for race approval.
5. If **unfit**, the **Horse Owner** receives restriction notice.
6. **Betting Agency** receives race event data once approved.
7. All records are stored centrally for reporting and decision support.

## üìå Status

‚úÖ Phase II Complete ‚Äì Business process modeled and explained using BPMN.





# Phase III

## üß© Logical Model Design ‚Äì HOOF-CARE MIS

This phase defines the logical data model for the HOOF-CARE Management Information System. It aligns with the problem definition in **Phase I** and the business process modeling in **Phase II**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

### üîπ Entities and Attributes

| **Entity**       | **Attributes** |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Horse**        | `HorseID (PK)`, `Name`, `Breed`, `DateOfBirth`, `OwnerID (FK)` |
| **Owner**        | `OwnerID (PK)`, `Name`, `ContactInfo` |
| **Trainer**      | `TrainerID (PK)`, `Name`, `ExperienceLevel`, `ContactInfo` |
| **Veterinarian** | `VetID (PK)`, `Name`, `Specialization`, `ContactInfo` |
| **TrainingLog**  | `TrainingID (PK)`, `HorseID (FK)`, `TrainerID (FK)`, `Date`, `Duration`, `PerformanceNotes` |
| **HealthRecord** | `RecordID (PK)`, `HorseID (FK)`, `VetID (FK)`, `Date`, `HealthStatus`, `MedicationGiven` |
| **RaceEvent**    | `EventID (PK)`, `EventName`, `Date`, `Location` |
| **Participation**| `ParticipationID (PK)`, `HorseID (FK)`, `EventID (FK)`, `Result`, `Rank`, `TimeCompleted` |
| **BettingInsight** | `InsightID (PK)`, `HorseID (FK)`, `EventID (FK)`, `Odds`, `Notes` |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Relationships & Constraints

### üîó Relationships

- **Horse ‚Üî Owner**: Many-to-One
- **Horse ‚Üî Trainer**: Many-to-Many via `TrainingLog`
- **Horse ‚Üî Veterinarian**: Many-to-Many via `HealthRecord`
- **Horse ‚Üî RaceEvent**: Many-to-Many via `Participation`
- **Horse ‚Üî BettingInsight**: Many-to-Many via `BettingInsight`

### ‚úÖ Constraints

- **1NF**: All values are atomic.
- **2NF**: All attributes depend fully on the primary key.
- **3NF**: No transitive dependencies between non-key attributes.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Data Scenarios

The design handles various real-world situations:

- Horses training with multiple trainers ‚Üí handled via `TrainingLog`.
- One veterinarian treating many horses ‚Üí handled via `HealthRecord`.
- Horses entering many races ‚Üí managed via `Participation`.
- Betting data tied to specific races ‚Üí handled via `BettingInsight`.

# Phase IV ‚Äì Database Creation and OEM Monitoring

## üìò Project: HOOF-CARE ‚Äì Horse Health & Performance Monitoring MIS

This document details the successful creation of a pluggable Oracle database (PDB) for the HOOF-CARE system and its integration with Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) for monitoring. Phase IV ensures proper setup, access control, and visibility into the system's runtime behavior.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è 1. Pluggable Database Creation

### ‚úÖ PDB Name
thurs_26858_Tresor_hoofcare_db


### ‚úÖ SQL Command Used

```sql
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE thurs_26858_Tresor_hoofcare_db
  ADMIN USER admin IDENTIFIED BY tresor
  FILE_NAME_CONVERT = (
    'C:/APP/TRESO/PRODUCT/21C/ORADATA/XE/PDBSEED/',
    'C:/APP/TRESO/PRODUCT/21C/ORADATA/XE/thurs_26858_Tresor_hoofcare_db/'
  );
```

This command creates the PDB using the PDBSEED template and assigns admin as the default administrator with DBA privileges.

üë§ 2. User Creation
‚û§ Admin User
Username: admin

Password: tresor

‚û§ Project Schema User

CREATE USER hoofcare_user IDENTIFIED BY tresor;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA TO hoofcare_user;

This user will be used in future phases for schema creation and PL/SQL development.

üîÑ 3. Listener and Service Configuration
To verify that the listener recognizes the newly created PDB:

lsnrctl services

The output confirmed the registration of the service:

Service "thurs_26858_Tresor_hoofcare_db" has 1 instance(s) ...

‚û§ Connection Tested Using SQL*Plus

sqlplus hoofcare_user/tresor@localhost:1521/thurs_26858_Tresor_hoofcare_db

üåê 4. Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) Monitoring
OEM Express was accessed via:

https://localhost:5500/em

‚û§ Login Credentials
User: hoofcare_user

Container: THURS_26858_TRESOR_HOOFCARE_DB

Password: tresor

üì∏ Screenshots of Monitoring:
